### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read.csv(here("data", "sf_trees","sf_trees.csv"))
```

### Basic wrangling reminders

Refresh some skills for data wrangling and summary statistics using functions in the  `dplyr` package. 

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph
```{r}
# counts of trees by legal status

top_5_status <- sf_trees %>%
  count(legal_status) %>% 
  drop_na(legal_status) %>%
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  relocate(tree_count) %>% 
  slice_max(tree_count, n =5)
  
```
